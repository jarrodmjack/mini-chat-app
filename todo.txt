Add workout templates feature:
Apply template controller is in place, figure out why stuff is being created, but no exercises are showing up on the home page. (workout and exercises are being created.)

For password reset:
User can currently navigate to forgot-password page on frontend, submit with an email and the link is console.logging in the backend console.
When navigating to that link, it takes the user to the /reset-password/id/token page which is being used to verify the token is legit. I left off figuring out how to make sure they are verified and next will figure out the actual reset. @ 18:30 in video

See if I can add the .lean method on any of my get queries to mongo (optimization)

Update node to 18 on machine and docker files

Make app look good on desktop
